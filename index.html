        <p1 class="body">Rock and roll jamband Strictly Liquid is a blossoming group from Florida whose original music speaks to the spirit of exploration. Drawing inspiration from the likes of Phish, Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers, The Beatles, and Pink Floyd, you’ll find that their sound is the culmination of Psych-Rock, Blues, Jazz, Funk, and a touch of Americana. From the touching melodies of “Halfway” to the cascading peaks of “Crow” their twists and turns showcase as broad a spectrum as that of human emotion. They make it a goal to connect with the audience uniquely every performance.</p1>
